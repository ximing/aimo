## Codebase Patterns
- Backend uses TypeDI for dependency injection - all services decorated with @Service()
- Controllers use routing-controllers decorators and auto-register via glob import
- LanceDB is used for vector database with auto-generated embeddings via EmbeddingService
- OpenAI integration exists via EmbeddingService - similar pattern should be used for AI tag generation
- All API endpoints use @CurrentUser() decorator for protected routes
- DTOs are in packages/dto/ and shared between frontend and backend
- Frontend uses @rabjs/react for reactive state management
- API calls are abstracted in apps/web/src/services/ and apps/web/src/api/
