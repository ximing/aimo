## Codebase Patterns
- MySQL configuration follows existing pattern in config.ts with typed interfaces
- Environment variables use sensible defaults (localhost:3306, root user, aimo database)
- Drizzle config references config.ts for MySQL credentials to maintain single source of truth
- Connection pooling configured with max 10 connections by default

## 2026-03-01 19:53 - US-001
- Installed Drizzle ORM dependencies: drizzle-orm (^0.45.1), mysql2 (^3.18.2), drizzle-kit (^0.31.9 dev)
- Created drizzle.config.ts at apps/server/ with MySQL dialect and schema/migration paths
- Added MySQLConfig interface to config.ts with host, port, user, password, database, connectionLimit fields
- Added mysql property to Config interface and initialized in config object with env var defaults
- Updated .env.example with MySQL configuration section (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PORT, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_CONNECTION_LIMIT)

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/package.json (dependencies)
- apps/server/drizzle.config.ts (created)
- apps/server/src/config/config.ts (added MySQLConfig interface and mysql config)
- .env.example (added MySQL section)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The project uses a centralized config.ts pattern - all new configuration should be added there with typed interfaces
- Environment variables should have sensible defaults for development (localhost, standard ports)
- The drizzle.config.ts references the main config to avoid duplicating connection details
- Typecheck must pass before committing - run `pnpm typecheck` from apps/server directory
