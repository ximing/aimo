## Codebase Patterns
- MySQL configuration follows existing pattern in config.ts with typed interfaces
- Environment variables use sensible defaults (localhost:3306, root user, aimo database)
- **Drizzle config must use env vars directly (not import config.ts) to avoid module resolution issues**
- **Drizzle config schema path must point to dist/ folder (compiled JS), not src/ (TS source)**
- Connection pooling configured with max 10 connections by default
- Drizzle schemas: Use mysqlTable() with foreign keys via .references(), JSON columns via .$type<T>()
- VARCHAR key lengths: 191 for primary/foreign keys (MySQL utf8mb4 index limit), 255+ for other fields
- Timestamps: Use { mode: 'date', fsp: 3 } for millisecond precision to match LanceDB
- All schemas must be exported from index.ts for migration generation
- **Always build before generating migrations: pnpm build && pnpm migrate:generate**
- **App startup sequence: IOC → MySQL → Migrations → LanceDB → Scheduler → Express server**
- Shutdown sequence: Scheduler → MySQL → LanceDB (reverse order for clean shutdown)
- Database connection is a singleton accessed via getDatabase() from db/connection.ts
- Migration runner uses temporary connection separate from main pool

- Installed Drizzle ORM dependencies: drizzle-orm (^0.45.1), mysql2 (^3.18.2), drizzle-kit (^0.31.9 dev)
- Created drizzle.config.ts at apps/server/ with MySQL dialect and schema/migration paths
- Added MySQLConfig interface to config.ts with host, port, user, password, database, connectionLimit fields
- Added mysql property to Config interface and initialized in config object with env var defaults
- Updated .env.example with MySQL configuration section (MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PORT, MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE, MYSQL_CONNECTION_LIMIT)

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/package.json (dependencies)
- apps/server/drizzle.config.ts (created)
- apps/server/src/config/config.ts (added MySQLConfig interface and mysql config)
- .env.example (added MySQL section)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The project uses a centralized config.ts pattern - all new configuration should be added there with typed interfaces
- Environment variables should have sensible defaults for development (localhost, standard ports)
- The drizzle.config.ts references the main config to avoid duplicating connection details
- Typecheck must pass before committing - run `pnpm typecheck` from apps/server directory

## 2026-03-01 20:01 - US-002
- Created comprehensive Drizzle ORM schema definitions for all MySQL tables
- Implemented 11 table schemas in apps/server/src/db/schema/ directory:
  - users.ts: User accounts with indexes on email/phone
  - categories.ts: Memo categories with foreign key to users
  - tags.ts: Tags with usage count tracking
  - memos.ts: Memo content with JSON arrays for attachments/tagIds, foreign keys to users and categories
  - memo-relations.ts: Directed memo relations with composite unique index on (sourceMemoId, targetMemoId)
  - attachments.ts: File metadata (excluding multimodalEmbedding which goes to LanceDB)
  - ai-conversations.ts: AI conversation sessions
  - ai-messages.ts: Messages with sources stored as JSON array
  - daily-recommendations.ts: Daily recommendations with unique constraint on (uid, date)
  - push-rules.ts: Push notification rules with channels as JSON
  - table-migrations.ts: Migration tracking metadata
- Created index.ts to export all schemas
- All schemas include proper primary keys, foreign key constraints with cascade deletes, and indexes on frequently queried fields
- Used Drizzle's timestamp with defaultNow() and $onUpdate() for automatic timestamp management
- Exported type-safe types using $inferSelect and $inferInsert
- Typecheck passes successfully

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/src/db/schema/*.ts (12 files created: 11 table schemas + index)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Drizzle schemas use mysqlTable() function with column definitions and indexes
- Foreign keys defined using .references() with onDelete cascade/set null options
- JSON columns typed using .$type<T>() for type safety
- Composite indexes/unique constraints defined in second parameter of mysqlTable()
- Timestamps use { mode: 'date', fsp: 3 } for millisecond precision matching LanceDB
- VARCHAR lengths: 191 for keys (MySQL utf8mb4 index limit), 255 for emails/paths, larger for URLs
- Index naming convention: field_idx for single field, descriptive names for composite indexes
- All schemas must be exported from index.ts for Drizzle migration generation

## 2026-03-01 20:15 - US-003
- Created database connection service with connection pooling at apps/server/src/db/connection.ts
- Implemented initializeDatabase() function that creates MySQL connection pool and Drizzle instance
- Configured connection pool with max 10 connections (default), keepAlive enabled
- Exported getDatabase() singleton accessor with initialization check
- Implemented checkConnectionHealth() method that tests connection with ping
- Implemented getPoolStatus() method to retrieve pool configuration
- Implemented closeDatabase() for graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
- Integrated database initialization into app.ts startup sequence (after IOC, before LanceDB)
- Added health check on startup that throws error if MySQL connection fails
- Added MySQL pool shutdown to graceful shutdown handler (closes before LanceDB)
- Used `any` type for db variable to avoid TypeScript type compatibility issues with drizzle return type
- Typecheck passes successfully

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/src/db/connection.ts (created)
- apps/server/src/app.ts (added imports and initialization calls)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Database initialization should happen early in app startup, after IOC but before other services
- Connection health checks on startup help catch configuration issues early
- Shutdown sequence matters: close MySQL before LanceDB to ensure clean shutdown
- Drizzle's type system can be complex - using `any` for singleton instance is acceptable for pragmatism
- Connection pool logging helps with debugging connection issues in production
- The app follows a pattern: IOC → MySQL → LanceDB → Scheduler → Express server

## 2026-03-01 20:30 - US-004
- Generated initial Drizzle migration files using drizzle-kit generate
- Created migration 0000_tough_rhino.sql with all 11 tables (users, categories, tags, memos, memo_relations, attachments, ai_conversations, ai_messages, daily_recommendations, push_rules, table_migrations)
- Reviewed generated SQL: verified all tables, indexes, foreign keys, unique constraints, and timestamps are correct
- Created migration runner script at apps/server/src/db/migrate.ts with automatic migration execution
- Integrated migrations into app.ts startup sequence (runs after MySQL connection, before LanceDB initialization)
- Added pnpm scripts to package.json: migrate (manual migration), migrate:generate (generate new migrations), migrate:studio (Drizzle Studio)
- Modified drizzle.config.ts to use environment variables directly instead of importing config.ts (avoids module resolution issues)
- Changed schema path in drizzle.config.ts to point to dist/db/schema/index.js (compiled output) for proper module resolution
- Typecheck passes successfully

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/drizzle.config.ts (updated to use env vars and point to dist folder)
- apps/server/drizzle/0000_tough_rhino.sql (created - initial migration)
- apps/server/drizzle/meta/0000_snapshot.json (created - migration metadata)
- apps/server/drizzle/meta/_journal.json (created - migration journal)
- apps/server/src/db/migrate.ts (created - migration runner)
- apps/server/src/app.ts (added runMigrations() call in startup sequence)
- apps/server/package.json (added migrate scripts)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Drizzle-kit needs compiled JavaScript files, not TypeScript source files - point schema path to dist/ folder in drizzle.config.ts
- Drizzle config should use environment variables directly (with dotenv/config) to avoid circular dependencies with config.ts
- Migration runner should use a temporary connection separate from the main connection pool
- Migrations should run after MySQL connection but before LanceDB initialization to ensure schema exists
- The migrate() function from drizzle-orm/mysql2/migrator handles migration execution automatically
- Migration files are stored in drizzle/ folder with SQL and metadata (snapshot + journal)
- App startup sequence is now: IOC → MySQL → Migrations → LanceDB → Scheduler → Express server
